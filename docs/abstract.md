## ABSTRACT
Using technological advancements and automation has significantly transformed logistics operations, improving efficiency and accuracy in parcel handling. The rapid expansion of e-commerce, further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has increased global parcel volumes, placing higher demands on sorting systems to operate with speed and precision.

The primary objective of this research is to design and develop an Automated Parcel Sorting Conveyor System using Raspberry Pi 5 with IDP System, Robotic Arm, and ATS to enhance sorting accuracy, operational efficiency, and energy sustainability. This system integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 (central controller), Raspberry Pi Camera V.3 Module (IDP-based label scanning), and a robotic arm (servo motor with PCA9685 driver) to automate parcel identification and routing.

A modular conveyor belt, powered by a 12V DC motor, synchronizes with photoelectric proximity sensors for real-time parcel tracking. To ensure uninterrupted operation, a dual-power ATS with solar energy integration (10Aâ€“60A PWM charge controller and photovoltaic panels) provides hybrid grid-renewable power management.

This system aims to serve as a scalable, low-cost alternative for small-to-medium logistics providers, aligning with global trends where e-commerce growth outpaces infrastructure readiness.
