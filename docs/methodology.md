# Methodology

## Research Design
The proposed research design focuses on developing an Automated Parcel Sorting Conveyor System using Raspberry Pi 5, IDP, a robotic arm, and an Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) to address inefficiencies in manual sorting, high error rates, and energy instability in logistics operations.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Development
- Conveyor belt driven by 12V DC motor and 2 Channel Relay
- Robotic arm powered by servo motors and PCA9685 driver
- Raspberry Pi Camera V.3 module for IDP processing
- Dual-source ATS with 100W solar panels and PWM charge controller

### Software Development
- IDP implementation using OpenCV and Tesseract for text extraction
- Robotic arm control via Python scripts
- ATS logic programmed in Arduino IDE
- Web interface using Flask framework

## Testing Methodology
- **Alpha Testing**: Controlled environment evaluation
- **Beta Testing**: Real-world logistics environment
- **Performance Metrics**: Sorting speed, IDP accuracy, energy consumption
